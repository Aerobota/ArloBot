# Each of these should be a list because the metatron_babelfish node will pic one at random from the list,
# Even if there is only one entry, it can still be a list. This makes it easy to add variation later, and easier to code the node.
# This is a location where you can put .wav files to play instead of speaking text,
# and then just put the filename in here in place of any text line.
# metatron_babelfish will use the .wav in the name to decide it is to be played with aplay intead of espeak
