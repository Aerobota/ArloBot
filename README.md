Metatron Package for Arlobot
===========================

This is a suplementary pacakge for the Arlobot package.
It provides basic "personality" and autonomous operation functions
to my ROS robot.

This packagee will be much less generic, depending more highly
on my specific robot design.

It will also be used to create and test concents that will
later move th Arlobot proper once they are ironed out.
