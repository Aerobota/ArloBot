ArloBot Package for ROS
===========================

This will be my attempt to build a Package for the Robot Operating System (ROS) to work with the Parallax Propeller based ArloBot

Currently this is just a place holder while I await parts from Parallax. Until then all development is being done on an ActivityBot.
That project his here: https://github.com/chrisl8/ActivityBot
