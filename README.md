Metatron Package for Arlobot
===========================

This is a suplementary pacakge for the Arlobot package.
It provides basic "personality" and autonomous operation functions
to my ROS robot.

This packagee will be much less generic, depending more highly
on my specific robot design.

It will also be used to create and test concents that will
later move th Arlobot proper once they are ironed out.

##Convenience Scripts##
Look in the scripts folder for a set of handy scripts for starting up and shutting down various aspects of Arlobot. These make up about 90% of the benefit of this repository!
