DEPRECATED REPOSITORY! Left here only for historical purposes.
This was a supplementary package for the Arlobot package, but all code is being moved into the Arlobot respository.
Do not set up this package!
Go to the ArloBot package https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot and follow the setup instructions there, and this package will also be installed automatically.

##Convenience Scripts##
