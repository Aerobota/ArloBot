Propeller C Code for ArloBot
============================

This is the code to build in SimpleIDE and download to your ArloBot's Activity Board EEPROM in order to control communicate with ROS over the USB serial interface.

Please note that you will need to have the Parallax ArloBot Libraries in your SimpleIDE workspace in order for this to build. Those libraries are included in this github repository, or you can get them here:
