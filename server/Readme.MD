ArloBot Cloud Server
====================

The purpose of the code here is to run in the "cloud" on a server, such as on a Digital Ocean droplet.  
This is to facilitate the communication between the robot on a network what is either private, or simply unstable.  
Example features are:  
1. Accept and spool incoming Twilio messages.  
2. Provide a consistent web interface URL that will redirect to the robot's current IP address.  
3. Create a "test" instance of the web site for testing and demonstration.
